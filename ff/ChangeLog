	* Implemented configuration file options for evaporation/rain
	* Implemented first version of oil behaviour + configuration options

v0.2.5
    * Improved sending of blocks close to clients
    * Improvements of tick CPU cost (aiming for < 50ms)
    * Changed liquids to only overflow blocks if it has a larger quantity (> 2)
    * Liquids have a chance to seep through dirt/sand blocks vertically or horizontally
    
v0.2.6
    * Netherrack can now melt if it is burning long enough, producing lava as output
    * Water is now evaporating at very low depths due to ground heat
    * Natural aquifiers are now (slowly) creating water that drips underground from gravel and dirt
    * Water anywhere in the world have a small chance of evaporating slowly
    * Tweaking the plant growing/consumption code
    
v0.2.7
    * Reduced CPU cost of tree finding algorithms
    * Tweaked tree finding algorithm to try to avoid crashing log-based houses
    * Made liquids flow faster under higher pressure differences
    * Fire and lava now evaporates nearby water
    * Water can seep through multiple layers of dirt/sand/gravel straight down, possibly performing an erosion at the same time 
    
v0.3.0
    * Found a bug where some trees would not fall properly (introduced in the CPU fix of 0.2.7)
    * Changed code for how growing plants spread, trying to make it look more natural
    * Fixed bug causing way too high evaporation rates
    * Major re-write of how the blocks/chunks are marked for update over the network leading to much smaller queues of block updates and higher throughput (= smaller "lag")
    * Major CPU performance rewriting, trying to stay below 50ms
    
v0.3.1
    * Fixed so liquids can flow through open doors and fences
    * New rule for rain amount "should" help replenish rivers and lakes quicker, while avoiding small ponds everywhere
    * Fixed a few bugs causing crashes in flat world types
    
v0.3.2
    * Fixed so liquids can interact with liquids straight below them (eg. water falling down into lava)
    * Removed a debug test that made some water flow too quickly almost randomly
    * Fixed so buildcraft oil acts renders correctly again (rendering method updated for MC1.5) 
    * Added support for the liquid "Hydrochloric Acid" from the mod Factorization. Be careful around that stuff!
    
v0.3.3
    * Initial support for gases. Implemented steam that is generated by boiling water two blocks above lava.
    
v0.3.4
    * Initial system for pressure levels of liquids. MC 1.6.2 update.
    
v0.3.5
    * Allowed variable "water falling speed" to quickly move water blocks in eg. water falls downwards. This saves lots of computations, especially when spawning the ocean.
    * Fixed bug with water not flowing out of the world when there are holes in the bedrock   
    * 
    
    
v0.3.99
    * Implemented completely new fluid dynamics, acceptable computational cost near oceans. 
    * Support for pressure levels of fluids. 
    * Steam is generated when water interacts with lava
    * Volcanoes!
    * First (very early) version of dynamic weather systems
