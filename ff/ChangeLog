	* Implemented configuration file options for evaporation/rain
	* Implemented first version of oil behaviour + configuration options

v0.2.5
    * Improved sending of blocks close to clients
    * Improvements of tick CPU cost (aiming for < 50ms)
    * Changed liquids to only overflow blocks if it has a larger quantity (> 2)
    * Liquids have a chance to seep through dirt/sand blocks vertically or horizontally
    
v0.2.6
    * Netherrack can now melt if it is burning long enough, producing lava as output
    * Water is now evaporating at very low depths due to ground heat
    * Natural aquifiers are now (slowly) creating water that drips underground from gravel and dirt
    * Water anywhere in the world have a small chance of evaporating slowly
    * Tweaking the plant growing/consumption code
    
v0.2.7
    * Reduced CPU cost of tree finding algorithms
    * Tweaked tree finding algorithm to try to avoid crashing log-based houses
    * Made liquids flow faster under higher pressure differences
    * Fire and lava now evaporates nearby water
    * Water can seep through multiple layers of dirt/sand/gravel straight down, possibly performing an erosion at the same time 
    
v0.3.0
    * Found a bug where some trees would not fall properly (introduced in the CPU fix of 0.2.7)
    * Changed code for how growing plants spread, trying to make it look more natural
    * Fixed bug causing way too high evaporation rates
    * Major re-write of how the blocks/chunks are marked for update over the network leading to much smaller queues of block updates and higher throughput (= smaller "lag")
    * Major CPU performance rewriting, trying to stay below 50ms
    
v0.3.1
    * Fixed so liquids can flow through open doors and fences
    * New rule for rain amount "should" help replenish rivers and lakes quicker, while avoiding small ponds everywhere
    * Fixed a few bugs causing crashes in flat world types
    
v0.3.2
    * Fixed so liquids can interact with liquids straight below them (eg. water falling down into lava)
    * Removed a debug test that made some water flow too quickly almost randomly
    * Fixed so buildcraft oil acts renders correctly again (rendering method updated for MC1.5) 
    * Added support for the liquid "Hydrochloric Acid" from the mod Factorization. Be careful around that stuff!
    
v0.3.3
    * Initial support for gases. Implemented steam that is generated by boiling water two blocks above lava.
    
v0.3.4
    * Initial system for pressure levels of liquids. MC 1.6.2 update.
    
v0.3.5
    * Allowed variable "water falling speed" to quickly move water blocks in eg. water falls downwards. This saves lots of computations, especially when spawning the ocean.
    * Fixed bug with water not flowing out of the world when there are holes in the bedrock   
    *

    * Volcanoes have varying degrees of activity at different points in time
    * Volcanoes have some mineral loot inside them, better at lower depths
    * Volcanoes grow non-straight before reaching the surface
    * Multithreading of the fluid dynamics code
    * New texture/rendering method for steam
        
v0.4.1
    * Fixed error computing movement in waters that are falling through non-air gases. (It should now not be possible to swim in the steam cloud over a water volcano)
    * Moved more parts multithreaded
    * Red-neck fishing, explosives in water are effective in a larger radius 
    * Changed shape of how volcanoes grow
    * Removed lighting computations from being performed by WorldManager whenever gas/fluid has moved
    * Faster, lowlevel, access to world blocks during sweeps
    * More parallelism, various optimisations
    * Fixed bug with tree ticking depending on number of nearby trees
    * Improved the 'extra-fire' option to spread forest fires easier
    * Made water extinguish fires
    * Added TerraFrimaCraft compatability 
    
v0.4.2
    * Added a few error checks 
    * Implemented first experimental version of pyroclastic clouds
    * Made textures of gases different depending on density. Also animated. 
    * Fixed bug that created too much steam in water-lava interactions
    * Made wind randomly change direction (slowly), changed movement behaviour of gases
    * Made trees spread by planting saplings (no dynamic tree growth yet)
    * Modified growth behaviour of volcanoes. Should look better after a few hours.
    
 v0.5.0
    * Physics of all blocks
    * Changed behaviour of leaves for new physics
    * Made vanilla stone very strong (and light), but not placeable by player
    * Uses bedrock as world anchors (to prevent the world from falling onto the four elephants on the great turtle). 
    * Re-enabled erosion. Decreased rain. Increased direct sunlight evaporation.
    * Patch for a vanilla in-efficiency with Entity.moveEntity - requires FFCore plugin
    
 v0.5.1
    * Increased number of packages sent from server to client in single player games
    * Added anchors points to the nether so it will not ALL come crashing down. 
    * Wooden supports in mines stronger. 
    * Tweaking elasticity to reduce earthquakes. 
    * Tweaking water consumption of crops
    * Tweaking volcano growth behaviour, tweaking ore generation in volcanos
    * Found a bug that duplicated puddles of water, leading to eventual flooding of the world
    * Fixed bug with physics and TileEntites (chests etc) 
    * Stone may shatter into cobblestone in a chain reaction when mining
    
v0.5.2
    * Added soundeffects for breaking/falling blocks and volcanoes
    * Removed unused settings and settings only used for debugging
    * Buildcraft compatability for block physics
    * Re-added buildcraft liquids as fluid liquids, needs work on pumps
    
v0.5.3
    * New config file with all the physics settings for every individual block
    * Removed bedrock pillars from flat worlds
    * Added option if smooth-stone should be allowed to be placed
    * Disabled physics in the end world
    * Disabled volcanos in hell, they cannot form stone there - hence will only flood the world
    
v0.5.4
    * Buildcraft fluids handled correctly, working pumps and textures.
    * Introduced turbines that can generate buildcraft energy from flowing liquids (intake at top, outlet bottom). 
      Wood very inefficient, Iron scale power with higher pressures (until it breaks), 
      Gold highest efficiency and redstone controllable, Diamond highest robustness to pressures and survives lava (usable in nether!).
    * Introduced gas turbines that can generate buildcraft energy from gas flows (intake bottom, outlet top).
      All gas turbines require nether quartz (lots of it), which you can get by running a quary in the nether using diamond generators and lava flows. 
      Iron is basic gas turbin, breaks at medium pressure. Gold is controllable, more efficent and breaks at high pressure.
      Diamond is slightly less efficient than gold, but will never break.  
    * Introduced liquid sensors (not final) that gives a signal output with "value" zero or 2-15. A lower value will only "reach" a lower number of blocks before it needs to be repeated. 
    * Note: pumping liquids with BC pumps+grates back into generators for infinite energy count as cheating... don't do that.
    * Fixed compatability bug with IC2-experimental and ProjectRed.
       
v0.5.5
    * Changed physics calculations, reduces random forces in the ground and gives more stable structures.
    * Fixed bug with wrong sapplings dropped from IC2 rubbertrees. 
    * New sound effects
    * Fixed crash when playing without fluid physics
    
v0.5.6
    * Added option "leaves-are-soft", disable if you want vanilla leaf behaviours. 
    * Modified growth of big trees in worldGenerator to guarantee branches are connected to trunk
    * Evaporation releases gas higher up in atmosphere
    * Changes to how often all liquids/gases are updated
    * Added option for #threads used in thread pool
    * Modified AI behaviour to herd when not feeding
    * Small amount of water should no longer destroy plants
    * Open doors should now allow water through
    * Changed rule for water condensation to happen only in larger clouds
    * Halved default rain amount from vanilla weather
    
 v0.5.7
    * Pistons can now push ANY blocks including TileEntities, sticky pistons pull many blocks in row. Some bugs for multi-block entities.
    * Fixes to erosion algorithm
    * Slight increase of ore generation within volcanoes
    * Fixed bug with shattering stone happening too often (probabilities where switched)
    * Fixed bug where crops couldn't grow
    * Fixed border-condition problem with chunk physics. Stable houses should stay stable when coming in/out of processed area.
    
  v0.5.8
    * Plants (non-crops) that are growing in wrong lighting situations will be eliminated
    * Added option to let mycellium spread over grass (but needs nearby water to do so)
    * Added first version of blockDispenser similar to BTW, but not exactly same behaviour 
    * Made textures for the liquid sensors and turbines
    * Added a longer-range sweep of water/gas physics done at intervals to even out effects of disappearing oceans etc. 
    * Some improvements to concurrency code for stability.
    * Fixed problem with falling blocks sticking to the side of objects they are falling next to.
    * Reduced default rain, increased default evaporation  (no more water-world?)
     
 v0.5.9
    * Removed all old usage of aquiring Chunks from World objects directly in favour of using the ChunkCache to avoid concurrent-biome-decorations.
    * Added new block to be used as WorldSupports instead of bedrock (bedrock is also a sink, but this block is generated by the pillars)
    * Added viscosity parameter for fluids 
    * Made some liquids (oil/fuel) burnable and explodeable. Flint/Steel doesn't work _on_ them but fire can spread to them. Try mixing lava and oil for some fun...
    * Made eating plants less common in animals to slow down their unsatiable hunger.  
    * Made animals flee from things that have hurt other animals (including players or other entities)
    * Made animals sleep at night (From 6pm to 5am +/- 30min)
