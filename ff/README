Volcanoes
---------

Volcanoes grow from a source known as a magma-plume. These magma plumes are randomly distributed 
in the minecraft world and are generated automatically depending on the position of any newly loaded
chunks (ie. they are procedurally generated as chunks are loaded/unloaded). By themselves the magma plumes
are not visible, *but* when active they will explode upwards and emit a large amount of liquid lava. 

All lava that are exposed to the sky  will over time cool and form cobblestone,stone and gravel on the surface.
Combined with how the lava flows out from magma plumes this means that the cooling lava will slowly form mountains that 
expanding up and outwards much like a "real" volcano.

If you want to tap into a magma plume in order to get an endless supply of lava, you may want to do so underground 
where the lava is not exposed to the sky. Try to avoid getting blown up (don't obstruct the main flow from the plume!)
or drowning in the lava.   

The activity of the volcanoes goes in a semi-regular cyclic pattern. The length and intensities of volcanic activities 
depend roughly on the large scale area of the world.
