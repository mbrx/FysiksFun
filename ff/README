About buildcraft (and other tech mods)
--------------------------------------

All pipes and other blocks are affected by physics as usual.
Pumps can only pump from a FULL block of liquid
The flood gate will only emit ONE block of liquid and then stop, to make it work again toggle it by a switch.
It's possible to get infinite energy by pumping water up using BC, and drive generators to get back the energy.
  - How can this be fixed?
    

Volcanoes
---------

Volcanoes grow from a source known as a magma-plume. These magma plumes are randomly distributed 
in the minecraft world and are generated automatically depending on the position of any newly loaded
chunks (ie. they are procedurally generated as chunks are loaded/unloaded). By themselves the magma plumes
are not visible, *but* when active they will explode upwards and emit a large amount of liquid lava. 

All lava that are exposed to the sky  will over time cool and form cobblestone,stone and gravel on the surface.
Combined with how the lava flows out from magma plumes this means that the cooling lava will slowly form mountains that 
expanding up and outwards much like a "real" volcano.

If you want to tap into a magma plume in order to get an endless supply of lava, you may want to do so underground 
where the lava is not exposed to the sky. Try to avoid getting blown up (don't obstruct the main flow from the plume!)
or drowning in the lava.   

The activity of the volcanoes goes in a semi-regular cyclic pattern. The length and intensities of volcanic activities 
depend roughly on the large scale area of the world.
 
 
 
 [list]
[*] some chunks are "volcano" chunks, depending on their position in the world.
[*] volcano chunks can be active/inactive in a pattern which last roughly 1-4 MC days. Nearby volcanoes tend to be active at the same time but there is a randomness to that. 
[*] when active a volcano will try to grow it's lava plume until it reaches fresh air. 
[*] It if cannot do so it will create an explosion on it's way "up".  It is these explosions that impregnates the nearby walls with new ores depending on the world depth. 
[*] Once on the surface the lava will slowly turn back into stones with a chance depending on if they have a clear line of sight to the sky. 
[*] After a long enough time (about 10 MC days or so) this flow of lava + harding to stone will have formed a small mountain. It will keep growing forever, but cannot grow higher than Y=200.

 Configuration files and modules
 -------------------------------
 
 The mod consists of a number of separate "modules" that are each much smaller than a mod and dependencies 
 making it hard to move them into separate forge mods. By enabling/disabling the different modules in the configuration file
 you can customize what aspects of FF that you want to play with. All modules are actived/disabled through the corresponding option
 in the section "modules" in the FysiksFun configuration file (minecraft/config/FysiksFun.cfg).
 
 Note that due to the dependencies not all combinations of modules are possible. The modules are as follows:
 
* tree-falling: A module that makes trees fall semi-realistic whenever a part of the trunk is removed or the lowermost block is air. The fallen tree will 
 not automatically turn into wood items to be picked up, but still need to be chopped up using an axe or other device.
 [b] Requirements: [/b] none.
* volcanoes: This enables the creation of dynamically occurring volcanoes that are an infinite source of lava as well as some ores 
 (iron, diamond, emerald) in a very uncomfortable place. The volcanoes evolve dynamically as time progress and will output more and more lava. 
 The lava slowly harden once on the surface of the world and form slowly growing mountains or even new islands in the oceans. 
 [b] Requirements: [/b] This module requires the module [u] fluids [/u] to be active.    
* dynamic-plants: This module activates a dynamic growth pattern for most plants (grass, flowers, trees) that will make them consume nearby water. 
 If they manage to consume water they will slowly spread to nearby areas.  If they cannot find nearby water they will slowly die.   
 [b] Requirements: [/b] This module requires the module [u] fluids [/u] to be active.
* new-animal-ai: Makes the vanilla animals (sheep, pigs, cows. Not horses) use a modified AI that keeps track of hunger and searches for food on a regular basis.
 If they manage to find food they will eat it, and may even produce even offspring. If they starve they will die. 
 [b] Requirements: [/b] none, but it is recommended to also use the dynamic-plants module since the plants otherwise will be depleted. 
* rain: This modules adds small amounts of water to the world whenever minecraft uses the "rain" animation. It is not the same as water falling from steam that reaches the top of the world. 
 This feature may be removed once the cycle of evaporating oceans -> steam clouds -> water has been tested better. 
  [b] Requirements: [/b] This module requires the module [u] fluids [/u] to be active.
* gases: A module that enables the use gases (currently only steam) that can exist in 16 different levels of pressure and that will move in the world according to the local wind (currently always +X, will be changed). The gases are traversable by the player and mobs but may cause damage.
 Once steam have risen to Y-level 128 then it will turn back into water and fall down to the world as rain. 
  [b] Requirements: [/b] none (I think?).
* nether-fun: Causes a few small effects in the nether such as turning burning nether slowly into lava.  
[b] Requirements: [/b] This module requires the module [u] fluids [/u] to be active.
* extra-fires: Increases the spread of fires somewhat. Needs more work.
  [b] Requirements: [/b] none.
