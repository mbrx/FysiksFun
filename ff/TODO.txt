Let pyroclastic clouds + water -> hydrochloric acid (when the right mod is installed)

Let erosion dump the removed block somewhere else.... walking towards lower pressures. (Lots of special cases to deal with!)
Water/rain should help stop wild-fires
Make piston based pumps work again

Debug when running with only tree felling. 



Buildcraft integration

Create list of "scary" blocks, let AI's run away from them 

Change probability of generating obsidian in lava-water interctions so that it is more likely where there are neighbours. Create clusters.
Lava-snow interactions.

Make sure that everything can be enabled/disabled in the settings file. 

Water lava interactions may create slabs instead of full blocks.... check emptiness below

To optimize:

   
 Manually call chunk updateSkyLight?  
   
Make gas perform randomwalk through water (ie. always move somewhere), so that it can eventually escape from underwater
Craftable tools that can break bedrock 
Blocks that can generate infinite water (for creative mode only!) 
Make diamonds by having coal blocks surrounded by highly pressurized lava

-- DEBUG: check that it works: Small liquid movements can go through plants

Typhoons / Volcanoes
Pyroplasm - lava turns into a gas, that can turn back into lava when it's at the top of the world


Implement "Wind" to move all gases
 - Push gases up when the terrain moves up (assuming they are above the highest terrain).  
 - Higher ground pushes winds "up" faster
 - Whenever gas reaches altitude 128, no more moving up. Chance each tick to become rain.

Client side: different drawing style of lone pieces of water in the sky "rain drop"

Liquid Reaction of Lava+Water: make steam.
Lava (or other heat sources) that boils water have a chance to turn into cobblestone
Fires that boil water have a chance to consume the block they are burning on

----------------------- 

Test that features still work

- Verify that trees fall correctly
- Test that fluids work with buildcraft 

Neccesarry implementations

- Script for moving textures into the deployed folder
- A clean MC+Forge to test the deployed zip against

Good to make implementation

- Redo the initialization scripts (pre-init/post-init) since they are depracated

Missing features / "removed" for now
- Erosion
- Items that are overflowed by liquids

-----------------------

New Zombie AI: Tries to eat dropped brains/meat as a distraction.

Let the player / entities occupy space that pushes away water (and gases?)

Analog signals using the ChunkTempData system? 
Pressure meters? Poor material type objects (wooden pressure meters) etc can break under high pressure. Diamond etc. doesnt. 


Gravity = weight * dY

(1) Check pressure in this cell and in neighbours
(2) Force = pressure difference + gravity
(3) Move a tiny bit of liquid OUT as long as force is positive.
    Liquids can never move IN to a cell (that will happen later). 
    Schedule a tick for all cells to whom we move a unit INTO
    
(4) Recompute pressure in this cell after moving liquids
    P(c) = max_i P(i) + gravity-from(i) - 1

(5) Recompute pressure in every neighbour, 
    but considering only us if it was changed then schedule a tick for them
 
-------------

Assume that we have an infinite loop involving a chain of nodes 1...N where the nodes are repeatedly
sceduled in the order: 1,2,3, ... N, 1, 2,3 ... N etc.

Every time that node X is called, then the pressure of the neighbours of X must have changed in order for X+1 to be scheduled
The the pressure of X must have changed during this update. 
(1)  If P(X) has increased, then P(X+1) needs to be called
(2)  If P(X) has decreased, then P(X+1) needs to be called

For (1) to happen we have two cases, 




-------------

Special blocks that extends the range with which water looks for fine equilibriums and/or faster water movement in general

Save "add liquid here" + maximuze pressure when we are failing to put liquid into a cell after flow-over

Explosive behaviour when acid hits water - move half of it to neighbouring cells (also up), create fires?

New liquid: blood

Associate 'genes' to all breedable mobs
Create mob behaviour for "swimming to shore" - possibly higher priority than attacking 

Move liquids "down" much faster by explicitly looping over them 

Move partial liquids fast downwards

Non-compressible fluids:
  if content >= 8 && neighbour-with-air:
    content = 0
    add content(8, the-neighbour)
    update all blocks except block above in 1 step
    update neighbour in 5 steps (or so)
  my-pressure = max(my-pressure, neighbour-pressure-at-same-level, pressure-above+1,pressure-below -1)

Boiling water only creates gases below a pressure point depending on the type of boiler. 
Each gasturbine moves one single gas to a lower pressure point. Needs a stack of them for efficiency

Implement fluid turbines also  
  

Block below's pressure = max(block-belows-pressure, my-pressure+1)



Create higher pressure versions of fluids


in "doExpensiveTicks" check for small liquidlevels on top of another non-liquid block and schedule some extra ticks just for them. 


Use the ORIENTATION of logs to figure out what is the main trunk of a tree!!!!!

Make oil and fuel combustible so it can burn (consuming it slowly in the process)
Make burning oil/fuel turn water above it into boiling water and finally steam
Make flowing blocks for buildcraft fuel?

Make it work with
Block. Name: tile.Flowing Hydrochloric Acid. ID: 2669
Block. Name: tile.Still Hydrochloric Acid. ID: 2670



* Create a separate thread (or two) that helps all liquidTick and blockMark scheduling (this is almost half of the simulation time!)

Let water fall "through" some opaque blocks - to prevent them from beeing stuck above torches etc

Water go through fences (makes a good grate)

Recompute light levels when lava is moved / removed?

Too difficult to get OUT of water?

water flowing over an edge into a liquid with which it can interact?

- Configuration file settings
   - Additional liquids to handle (by block tile name)


- Making volcaninc eruptions
- Make it rain lava in the nether?
- Make oil cause explosions when touching lava?

- Test how the nether works
- Test how the END works
- Test mystcraft

Make a patch for mobs that are partly falling through the ground? (Both client and server side?)


Client side: sideways water drops on a block through which we may seep water?

 *  TODO: deal with waterfalls and direct erosion below them


Make trees that actually grow

Check out plasmacraft - make compatible?
http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1305647-151smpssp-plasmacraft-032-the-legacy-continues62212/page__hl__%20industrialcraft2


Determine best direction for trees to fall in

Small chance of evaporation into direct air?
Chance of evaporation when lava is near?


Make octupuses eat water lillies?

More plants can grow?

Make hostile mobs attack BlockEntities

Animal hearding behaviour?

Spread plants only in direct line-of-sight? (or with a random walk?)

Check that plants have sunlight, otherwise die
